We strive to create a loving community of children, parents, teachers, and friends.</p> <p>Our staff include talented, highly trained, and academically credentialed teachers who nurture and facilitate integrated learning, following a child's own rhythms.  Our responsive teachers understand that children are learning all the time through active and purposeful involvement with people, materials, and ideas.</p> <p>We use the Creative Curriculum, a play-orientated, child-initiated approach.  The Creative Curriculum fosters a dynamic environment to satisfy the young child's natural sense of wonder, sociability, eagerness to explore and problem solve, enthusiasm for quality literature, and aptitude to learn through play.</p> <p>In addition to classroom experiences, children play on our large, private outdoor playground, go on neighborhood walks, and have the option to take field trips to exciting destinations.  We also offer enrichment programs in Spanish, music, and gymnastics.</p> <p>We see parents and teachers as partners, and value close, regular, and open communication.  Our environment respects individuality and differences.  We have an open door policy, and parents are welcome to visit anytime.</p>", "people"=>[{"name"=>"Janine Fetters", "pic"=>5, "position"=>"Executive Director", "email"=>"TMCDC_Director@ao.uscourts.gov"}, {"name"=>"Kiysha Ramey-Jenkins", "pic"=>"k", "position"=>"Associate Director", "email"=>"TMCDC@ao.uscourts.gov"}], "social"=>[{"title"=>"twitter", "url"=>"http://twitter.com/jekyllrb"}, {"title"=>"facebook", "url"=>nil}, {"title"=>"stack-overflow", "url"=>"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll"}, {"title"=>"bitbucket", "url"=>"http://bitbucket.org/jekyll"}, {"title"=>"github", "url"=>"http://github.com/jekyll"}], "address"=>[{"line"=>"2001 14th St, SE"}, {"line"=>"Washington, DC 20020"}], "contact"=>{"description"=>"Please contact us for more information about the Center.
